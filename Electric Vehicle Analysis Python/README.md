# Overview

Welcome to my analysis of the EV Market for year 2022 to 2024. This project was created in order to understand the EV Market as part of the expansion plans of Atliq Motors. 

# Problem Statement 

AtliQ Motors is an automotive giant from the USA specializing in electric vehicles (EV). In the last 5 years, their market share rose to 25% in electric and hybrid vehicles segment in North America. As a part of their expansion plans, they wanted to launch their bestselling models in India where their market share is less than 2%. Bruce Haryali, the chief of AtliQ Motors India wanted to do a detailed market study of existing EV/Hybrid market in India before proceeding further. Bruce gave this task to the data analytics team of AtliQ motors and as a Data Analyst we need to analyze the EV Market. 

# The Questions

Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:

1.	List the top 3 and bottom 3 makers for the fiscal years 2023 and 2024 in terms of the number of 2-wheelers sold.
2.	Identify the top 5 states with the highest penetration rate in 2-wheeler and 4-wheeler EV sales in FY 2024.
3.	List the states with negative penetration (decline) in EV sales from 2022 to 2024? 
4.	What are the quarterly trends based on sales volume for the top 5 EV makers (4-wheelers) from 2022 to 2024?
5.	How do the EV sales and penetration rates in Delhi compare to Karnataka for 2024?
6.	List down the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) in 4-wheeler units for the top 5 makers from 2022 to 2024.
7.	List down the top 10 states that had the highest compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2022 to 2024 in total vehicles sold.
8.	What are the peak and low season months for EV sales based on the data from 2022 to 2024? 
9.	What is the projected number of EV sales (including 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers) for the top 10 states by penetration rate in 2030, based on the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) from previous years? 
10.	Estimate the revenue growth rate of 4-wheeler and 2-wheelers EVs in India for 2022 vs 2024 and 2023 vs 2024, assuming an average unit price.


# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the EV market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **Python:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights.I also used the following Python libraries:
    - **Pandas Library:** This was used to analyze the data. 
    - **Matplotlib Library:** I visualized the data.
    - **Seaborn Library:** Helped me create more advanced visuals. 
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for executing my Python scripts.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

## Import & Clean Up Data

I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
# Importing Libraries
import pandas as pd
import os 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import calendar


# Loading Data
df = pd.read_csv(r'E:\RPC12_Input_For_Participants\Electric Vehicle Analysis Python\datasets\electric_vehicle_sales_by_makers.csv')
df2 = pd.read_csv(r'E:\RPC12_Input_For_Participants\Electric Vehicle Analysis Python\datasets\electric_vehicle_sales_by_state.csv')

# Data Cleanup
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'], format='mixed')
df2['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df2['date'], format='mixed')
```


# The Analysis

Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

## 1.	List the top 3 and bottom 3 makers for the fiscal years 2023 and 2024 in terms of the number of 2-wheelers sold.

To find the most the top 3 and bottom 3 makers for the fiscal years 2023 and 2024 in terms of the number of 2-wheelers sold i created a function to find the Fiscal Year and then filtered the date for 2 wheelers and then created teh function to find top 3  and bottom 3. Then again filtered the date for year 2023 and 2024 in order to get the results. 

### View the code with detailed steps here:.

```python
def get_fiscal_year(date):
    fiscal_year_start_month = 4  
    fiscal_year_start_day = 1
    year = date.year
    month = date.month
    day = date.day
    
    if month < fiscal_year_start_month or (month == fiscal_year_start_month and day < fiscal_year_start_day):
        fiscal_year = year - 1
    else:
        fiscal_year = year

    return f"FY{fiscal_year+1}"


df['fiscal_year'] = df['date'].apply(get_fiscal_year)

df_2_wheelers = df[df['vehicle_category'] == '2-Wheelers']
df_filtered = df_2_wheelers[df_2_wheelers['fiscal_year'].isin(['FY2023', 'FY2024'])]
df_4_wheelers = df[df['vehicle_category'] == '4-Wheelers']

final_results = df_filtered.groupby(['fiscal_year', 'maker'])[['electric_vehicles_sold']].sum().reset_index()

def get_top_bottom(df, fiscal_year):
    df_year = df[df['fiscal_year'] == fiscal_year]
    df_sorted = df_year.sort_values(by='electric_vehicles_sold', ascending=False)
    top_3 = df_sorted.head(3)
    bottom_3 = df_sorted.tail(3)
    return top_3, bottom_3

top_3_FY2023, bottom_3_FY2023 = get_top_bottom(final_results, 'FY2023')
top_3_FY2024, bottom_3_FY2024 = get_top_bottom(final_results, 'FY2024')

```


### Visualize Data

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 8))
ax = sns.barplot(data = final_results, x = 'maker', y ='electric_vehicles_sold',hue='fiscal_year',palette='Blues',width=1)

### Insights:

- OLA Electric is clearly the winner for FY 2023 and 2024. 
- Even thought OLA Electric leads the way. The competition is there with the others since the positions in each year has been changed  

## 2.	Identify the top 5 states with the highest penetration rate in 2-wheeler and 4-wheeler EV sales in FY 2024.


To find top 5 states with the highest penetration rate in 2-wheeler and 4-wheeler EV sales in FY 2024. Using the previous function i created the Fiscal year column and then filtered the data based on Fiscal year and created a function to find the penetration rate for both 2 wheelers and 4 wheelers and then again filtered to top 5 to get the desired result.

### Insights:

- Kerala is top 2 and top 1 for 2- wheeler and 4 - wheeler respectively. 
- It seems the tourism is having impact on the penetration rate as the state is a tourism hub. Even GOA is known for tourism is listed in the top 5 for both category. 



## 3.	List the states with negative penetration (decline) in EV sales from 2022 to 2024? 


To find List the states with negative penetration (decline) in EV sales from 2022 to 2024. Created the function to find the penetration rate and then filtered and sorted the data to find the penetration rate for 2022  and 2024 separately to find any decline in sales.
